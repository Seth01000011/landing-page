battleship project for TOP

working on receiveAttack function - need to iterate through ships - iterating through 
all x dimensions - then iterating through y dimensions - to determine if the “attack” 
coordinates match up with any coordinates on the ship. If so, add “hit” to ship, and 
return true. else return false

have to think about hitting the same spot twice - this should not count, but as of right
 now it will. store coordinates of previous “hits”, and intercept that at the beginning 
 of receive attack to prevent future hits?

create array to hold all previous “hits”

or array to hold ALL shots. just intercept any prevoiusly-made shot and say “its been 
done already, choose another?”
