// Once the descriptions are added, I also need to make the submit and clear
// buttons actually empty the inputs... .textContent = ""?
// Check the "library" example for how I did it there.

// Now that the modal pops up and disappears with no issues, and the inputs
// appear as well, its also time to give the modal the ability to create an object using
// the Task class creator, and append that to the DOM. That should be... called
// by and in the modal module? IDK. Or here?

// Once the modal is able to create a task, automate the creation of a card.
// Would that be within the Task module? As a method of the Task class?

// Should the modal simply return a list of strings (The information for a Task object),
// which would then
// be used by Task? I think so. I would have to refactor Task to accept an array
// instead of multiple args.

// Then create a card using the Task object! Automate that... how?

// to handle creation and appending of Task to DOM.

// create a separate module for the popup form input, to create new tasks from the
// #add_task button. Use the "library" input form as an example to work from.

// figure out how to use local_storage module to save the added task to user's local
// storage.
