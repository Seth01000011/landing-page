            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>
                A few months ago, my friend asked me to get this civic off of his
                property. He had been driving it some while back when it lost power
                on the highway, and then shutoff. He said it was low on oil, but
                otherwise he didn't know what was wrong with it.
            </p>

            <h3>He said it wouldn't start</h3>
            <p>
                So I hooked up 2 truck-sized batteries in parallel with some huge
                cables... And it started!

            <h3>So, off to the pick'n'pull</h3>
            <p>
                I kept an eye on the local pick'n'pull's inventory for a Civic to
                show up with an R18 engine. Finally, one showed up.
            </p>

            <p>
                With my dad's help, we started removing the extra components we
                didn't need, and disconnecting any electrical connections and hoses
                that were holding the engine in.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yeah, it was a bit sketchy hanging out underneath the Civic with so
                much of it disconnected and ready to pull. But it had to be done.
                Then, we lifted.

            <p>
                We had some trouble getting the torque converter to stay in the
                transmission, but eventually got it separated and the engine out.
            </p>

            <p>
                And checked out of the pick'n'pull! We actually were able to get
                from 0 to check-out in 3 hours! I was pretty proud of my Dad and I
                to pull that off.

            <p>
                And finally we were on the way home, engine secured in the truck
                bed.

            <h3>Pulling the victim's engine</h3>
            <p>
                While we were able to pull the engine in the junkyard rather rapidly,
                I had to ensure that I didn't damage anything pulling the victim's
                engine. I wanted the install of the replacement engine to go as
                smoothly as possible.

                alt="The Civic resting on a pallet infront of the recipient">
            <p>
                I knew it would take some time, so I set up a pallet to keep the
                donor engine high and dry while I was working on preparing the
                blown engine to be pulled.
            </p>

                alt="Donor engine, wrapped to protect it from the weather">
            <p>
                I wrapped up the donor engine with some plastic to protect it from
                any potential rain. I'm taking my time, and don't want to rush or
                burn out.

            blown engine">
            <p>
                I didn't want to have to evacuate or refill the A/C system or power
                steering <sup>(not pictured)</sup>, so I made sure they were out of
                the way for pulling the engine.

                alt="Getting the donor engine on an engine stand">
            <p>
                Once I was close to being able to pull the blown engine, I set up the
                donor engine on an engine stand so that I could swap over accessories.
            </p>
            <img src="../autoProjectImages/civicEngineSwap/18blownEngineOut.jpg" alt="Blown engine, removed from Civic">
            <p>
                Aaaaand it's out! We struggled some, but we were able to pull both
                the engine and transmission together. This will be useful, as I have
                to swap over some components since the donor is from an automatic,
                and the recipient is a manual. Also note the board assisting in holding
                up the donor engine. I wasn't comfortable with only 4 bolts on one
                side of the engine, so my Dad fabricated a secondary engine support.

            <h3>Then the swapping begins</h3>
            <p>
                I minimized the accessories on the donor engine when we pulled it,
                and some of the accessories on the recipient are in better condition.
                So, begins the process of swapping over components.

                !!!!!Insert video here of knock knock, looking at rod bearing assembly
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, due to rain interrupting nearly every day of work,
                I was unable to get a good number of images while I was swapping
                over components. One thing I did notice is that the donor engine
                had significantly less carbon buildup in the intake passages,
                potentially indicating a lower-mileage engine from the junkyard
                compared to the 170,000 mile engine the Civic originally had.

                Then, once a majority of components were swapped, the oil pan was
                on, and any sealant applied that needed to be, we mated the
                trans and the engine for installation.

                Unfortunately the installation of the engine was all hands on
                deck, and we weren't able to capture any images of the actual
                engine and transmission installation, but here it is!

            <p>
                I ran the engine for all of 10 seconds to ensure I didn't hear
                any awful noises - But with the catalytic converter not installed,
                the engine was quite loud and would mask many less noticeable
                noises. It certainly sounded better than the old engine!

                Here you can see many of the accessories have been installed,
                including the alternator, catalytic converter, battery tray,
                air intake, and more.

                Then in goes the radiator, after inspecting to ensure that nothing
                crawled in while it was out... Here is where I double checked that
                any bolts and nuts were properly tightened and secured, as well
                as any hoses for the cooling system, vacuum, and EGR systems.

                Here is after I installed the radiator support. Not pictured is
                all of the brackets in the rear of the engine secured, installation
                of the power steering pump, and passenger CV axle. Since there
                will be little risk from here on out, I was able to remove my
                cardboard protection of the A/C condensor.
