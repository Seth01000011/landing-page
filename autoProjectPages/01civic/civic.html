The other, a picture-based

                <p>
                    A few months ago, my friend asked me to get this civic off of his
                    property. He had been driving it some while back when it lost power
                    on the highway, and then shutoff. He said it was low on oil, but
                    otherwise he didn't know what was wrong with it.

                <p>
                    I kept an eye on the local pick'n'pull's inventory for a Civic to
                    show up with an R18 engine. Finally, one showed up.

                    With my dad's help, we started removing the extra components we
                    didn't need, and disconnecting any electrical connections and hoses
                    that were holding the engine in.

                <p>
                    Yeah, it was a bit sketchy hanging out underneath the Civic with so
                    much of it disconnected and ready to pull. But it had to be done.
                    Then, we lifted.

                    We had some trouble getting the torque converter to stay in the
                    transmission, but eventually got it separated and the engine out.

                    And checked out of the pick'n'pull! We actually were able to get
                    from 0 to check-out in 3 hours! I was pretty proud of my Dad and I
                    to pull that off.

                <h3>Pulling the victim's engine</h3>
                <p>
                    While we were able to pull the engine in the junkyard rather rapidly,
                    I had to ensure that I didn't damage anything pulling the victim's
                    engine. I wanted the install of the replacement engine to go as
                    smoothly as possible.

                <p>
                    I knew it would take some time, so I set up a pallet to keep the
                    donor engine high and dry while I was working on preparing the
                    blown engine to be pulled.

                    <p>
                        I wrapped up the donor engine with some plastic to protect it from
                        any potential rain. I'm taking my time, and don't want to rush or
                        burn out.

                    I didn't want to have to evacuate or refill the A/C system or power
                    steering <sup>(not pictured)</sup>, so I made sure they were out of
                    the way for pulling the engine.

                <p>
                    Once I was close to being able to pull the blown engine, I set up the
                    donor engine on an engine stand so that I could swap over accessories.

                <p>
                    Aaaaand it's out! We struggled some, but we were able to pull both
                    the engine and transmission together. This will be useful, as I have
                    to swap over some components since the donor is from an automatic,
                    and the recipient is a manual. Also note the board assisting in holding
                    up the donor engine. I wasn't comfortable with only 4 bolts on one
                    side of the engine, so my Dad fabricated a secondary engine support.

                    I minimized the accessories on the donor engine when we pulled it,
                    and some of the accessories on the recipient are in better condition.
                    So, begins the process of swapping over components.

                    Unfortunately, due to rain interrupting nearly every day of work,
                    I was unable to get a good number of images while I was swapping
                    over components. One thing I did notice is that the donor engine
                    had significantly less carbon buildup in the intake passages,
                    potentially indicating a lower-mileage engine from the junkyard
                    compared to the 170,000 mile engine the Civic originally had.

                    Then, once a majority of components were swapped, the oil pan was
                    on, and any sealant applied that needed to be, we mated the

                    any awful noises - But with the catalytic converter not installed,
                    the engine was quite loud and would mask many less noticeable
                    noises. It certainly sounded better than the old engine!

                    any bolts and nuts were properly tightened and secured, as well

                    will be little risk from here on out, I was able to remove my
                    cardboard protection of the A/C condensor.
