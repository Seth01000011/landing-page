            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>
                A few months ago, my friend asked me to get this civic off of his
                property. He had been driving it some while back when it lost power
                on the highway, and then shutoff. He said it was low on oil, but
                otherwise he didn't know what was wrong with it.

            <p>
                So I hooked up 2 truck-sized batteries in parallel with some huge
                cables... And it started!

            <h3>So, off to the pick'n'pull</h3>
            <p>
                I kept an eye on the local pick'n'pull's inventory for a Civic to
                show up with an R18 engine. Finally, one showed up.

            <p>
                With my dad's help, we started removing the extra components we
                didn't need, and disconnecting any electrical connections and hoses
                that were holding the engine in.

             <p>
                 Yeah, it was a bit sketchy hanging out underneath the Civic with so
                 much of it disconnected and ready to pull. But it had to be done.
                 Then, we lifted.
             </p>

             <p>
                 We had some trouble getting the torque converter to stay in the
                 transmission, but eventually got it separated and the engine out.

             <p>
                 And checked out of the pick'n'pull! We actually were able to get
                 from 0 to check-out in 3 hours! I was pretty proud of my Dad and I
                 to pull that off.

                 And finally we were on the way home, engine secured in the truck
                 bed.

                While we were able to pull the engine in the junkyard rather rapidly,
                I had to ensure that I didn't damage anything pulling the victim's
                engine. I wanted the install of the replacement engine to go as
                smoothly as possible.

            <p>
                I knew it would take some time, so I set up a pallet to keep the
                donor engine high and dry while I was working on preparing the
                blown engine to be pulled.

            <p>
                I wrapped up the donor engine with some plastic to protect it from
                any potential rain. I'm taking my time, and don't want to rush or
                burn out.

            <p>
                I didn't want to have to evacuate or refill the A/C system or power
                steering <sup>(not pictured)</sup>, so I made sure they were out of
                the way for pulling the engine.

            alt="Getting the donor engine on an engine stand">
            <p>
                Once I was close to being able to pull the blown engine, I set up the
                donor engine on an engine stand so that I could swap over accessories.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aaaaand it's out! We struggled some, but we were able to pull both
                the engine and transmission together. This will be useful, as I have
                to swap over some components since the donor is from an automatic,
                and the recipient is a manual. Also note the board assisting in holding
                up the donor engine. I wasn't comfortable with only 4 bolts on one
                side of the engine, so my Dad fabricated a secondary engine support.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="swappingComponents">
            <h3>Then the swapping begins</h3>
            <p>
                I minimized the accessories on the donor engine when we pulled it,
                and some of the accessories on the recipient are in better condition.
                So, begins the process of swapping over components.
